Fitness Workout Tracker with Progress Visuals

Hey everyone! 👋

For my semester project, I'm building a **Fitness / Workout Tracker with Progress Visuals** — a simple yet powerful web app to help users log workouts, track body stats, and visualize their progress over time.

Why this project?

I love going to the gym, but I often forget what I lifted last time or how I'm progressing (this goes for cardio too). A lot of people (myself included) find it hard to stay consistent with workouts because tracking exercises, sets, reps, weights, cardio, and overall progress is a hassle.

My goal is to create an **easy-to-use web app** where users can:
- Quickly log their workouts
- Track body stats (weight, measurements, etc.)
- See beautiful visual progress charts to stay motivated and see how far they've come

I'm really excited about this because it will be useful for me personally and hopefully for others too!

Current Status

Week 1 Progress (February 2025)**  
I've started with a **basic console-based prototype** in Python to help me think through the core data structure and user flow before jumping into the full MERN stack. This version includes:

- A simple menu interface
- Ability to log workouts (date, exercise name, sets, reps, optional weight)
- View all logged workouts in a readable list
- In-memory storage (list of dictionaries) — saving to file and database will come later

This is intentionally very basic so I have room to grow it each week. The Python version is just a proof-of-concept / planning tool — the final project will be a full web app using the MERN stack.

The code is live here:  
→ [`main.py`](main.py)  
→ [`workout_tracker.py`](workout_tracker.py)

Final Goals (by end of semester)

- User authentication (sign up / login with JWT)
- Workout logging (exercises, sets, reps, weights, cardio sessions)
- Body stat tracking (weight, body measurements, etc.)
- Multiple progress charts and visualizations
- Clean, responsive UI
- Detailed README with screenshots and (hopefully) a live demo link

Technologies I'll be using

- **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
- **React** + **Tailwind CSS** for the frontend
- **Chart.js** for beautiful progress charts
- **JWT** for authentication
- Possibly more as I go (like React Router, Axios, etc.)

(The current Python prototype is just temporary scaffolding — it will be replaced as we move to the web version.)

Resources & Tutorials I'm Following

I've been looking around for beginner-friendly resources:
- MERN Stack Basics & Exercise Tracker Tutorial (YouTube)
- Full MERN Authentication with JWT (YouTube)
- Charts for Progress → [Chart.js official docs](https://www.chartjs.org/)
- Tailwind CSS with React (YouTube)

How I'll build it

I'll start small and build incrementally:

1. Basic React frontend setup with Tailwind  
2. Backend setup (Node/Express + MongoDB)  
3. User auth  
4. Workout & stat logging  
5. Progress charts  
6. Polish + deployment  

I'll use **AI tools** (like Grok, ChatGPT, etc.) to help with code snippets and debugging, but I'll credit them in comments and in this README.

Progress Screenshots (coming soon!)

*(I'll add screenshots here as I build features — dashboard, workout log, charts, etc.)*

For now, here are some example visuals of what I'm aiming for in the final version:

Feel free to follow my progress, give feedback, or even contribute if you're interested. I'm looking forward to building this and sharing updates!

Happy lifting! 💪
